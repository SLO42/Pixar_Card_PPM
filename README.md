# Pixar_Card_PPM
Was handed a card with a bunch of scrunched code on a card. telling me to pipe the contents into a pixar.ppm file.very interesting after having gone through the code to understand it. here is a link to some more info on the Card and its origin: https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/ 

Thanks to 42 Student sbalcort for creating the new updateded code. as well as putting the gif together. more testing can be done! PROGRESS!!!
